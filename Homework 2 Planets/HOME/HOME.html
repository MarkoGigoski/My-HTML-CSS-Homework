                            <b>Telescopes are optical instruments that use lenses, curved mirrors, or a combination of both to observe distant objects, or various devices used to monitor far-away things by their emission, absorption, or reflection of electromagnetic radiation. The first known telescopes were refracting telescopes invented in the Netherlands at the beginning of the 17th century by using glass lenses</b>

                                With a 200mm aperture, this telescope opens up new details in deep sky observing for the observer as compared to smaller telescopes. With 78% more light gathering ability compared to a 150mm telescope, even the delicate spiral arms of many galaxies and additional structures in other nebulae can be observed. Globular clusters, such as the famous M13 cluster in Hercules, can be resolved at their edges to a large degree. The parabolic primary mirror is diffraction limited, allowing sharp images of the object. The very high-contrast optics are optimised by the use of a small secondary mirror and thin secondary mirror spider vanes, allowing sharp and bright planetary observing even at higher magnification. The OTA has a solid 2-inch Crayford focuser for a low image shift focusing - of particular importance at high magnifications and for astrophotography. The use of 2 inch eyepieces allows the maximum possible field of view to be exploited. The telescope has an f5 aperture ratio, putting it in the class of 'fast' Newtonian telescopes, so this telescope is particularly well suited to astrophotography.

                                AC 90/900 optics.This optics is equipped with an achromatic objective. Because of a special combination of two lenses within the objective, most of the colour aberrations can be corrected. Thus, you do not have to face so many disturbing irregularities as usual with common Fraunhofer refractors. The aperture ratio of 1:10 has an additional positive effect.The Skywatcher AZ-3 is a practical altazimuth mount, easy-to-use and providing good stability.It can serve as a base for terrestrial or astronomical observing and support telescopes or spotting scopes up to a maximum weight of 5kg (refractors of up to 120mm aperture and reflectors of up to 150mm diameter).The AZ-3 has horizontal quick adjustment plus a locking screw, and vertical quick adjustment with a slipper clutch. There is fine adjustment with flexible slow motions available on both axes. The tracking is absolutely smooth and sensitive adjustment and allows fine adjustment even at high magnification.The vertical angle can be adjusted between 50 and 90 degrees, allowing viewing from the horizon up to nearly the zenith and panning 360Â°. The AZ-3 mount is hence equally suited for terrestrial and astronomical observing. The telescope/spotting scope is mounted via tube ring clak.

                                The N 114/1000 telescope:This classical Newtonian design offers a 114mm aperture in a compact design. It is therefore a perfect telescope for beginners, very easy to transport, simple to use and with no special training needed to operate it. This telescope will show you the rings of Saturn and the cloud bands and moons of Jupiter, looking like its own small own planetary system. But the brighter nebulae and star forming regions such as the Orion Nebula can also be seen. Go on a voyage of discovery!The EQ-1Mount:This parallactic mount provides the possibility of accurately aligning the optics to the Pole Star. The correct polar elevation can be set for any observing site or geographical latitude. Slow motions on the Right Ascension and Declination axes allow objects to be precisely adjusted in the field of view and followed, with a counterweight provided for precise counterbalancing of the optics.The EQ-1 mount comes as one of two variants, with a free-standing tripod or a table-top tripod. You can find more details in the technical data. The free-standing tripod is extendable to between 70cm and 120cm high and has a tray, providing space for eyepieces and other accessories. The table-top tripod is extremely compact and light, and thus ideal for trips or holidays. The smaller of the EQ mounts is extremely light and compact and can fit into virtually any travel bag. It is easy enough to set up for any beginner and can be just as easily used by children. A motor for tracking in right ascension is an optional upgrade.

                                N 150/750 telescope: This versatile Newtonian reflecting telescope provides both beginners and more experienced amateur astronomers plenty of light and high stability for a very modest price. It collects so much light with its generous 150mm diameter that distant DSOs such as the Ring Nebula in Lyra or the Dumbbell Nebula become beautifully visible and globular clusters, such as M13, resolve into a multitude of individual stars at their edges. Planetary observing provides rich detail in images of Saturn, Jupiter, Venus and Mars. The f5 focal ratio means this reflector falls into the class of 'fast' Newtonian telescopes. This telescope is therefore particularly suitable for astrophotography. The light gathering capacity of the 150 is 460 times greater than that of the naked eye alone (with a 7mm fully dilated pupil)
