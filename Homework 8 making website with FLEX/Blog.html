You don't have to be a skier to ride the Mt. Rainier Gondola, which will whisk you by beautiful evergreen trees as you take in a bird's eye view of the surrounding snow-covered mountain peaks. Just make sure you secure your day pass ahead of time on their website. .

                    <h4>Seefeld - Tirol, Austria</h4>
                    One of the best ski resorts in Europe for non-skiers isn't a great choice for hard-core skiing enthusiasts, but it is a very picturesque village with opportunities for Nordic walking, tobogganing, paragliding, ice skating, and swimming. It also has a number of wellness activities. If you'd like to try cross-country skiing, this is one of the best places in the world for the sport.

                    <h4>Sun Valley Resort - Sun Valley, Idaho</h4>
                    Named for its bright blue skies and frequently sunny weather, Sun Valley is ideal for slope-seekers as well as anyone else in search of an adventurous resort escape. This top winter area in Idaho offers activities for just about everyone, including Dollar Mountain's popular tubing hill. A lift whisks tubers to the top of the run, where circular tubes spin down the slope at lightning speeds.

                    <h4>St. Moritz, Switzerland</h4>
                    Skiers know St. Moritz as one of the best ski destinations in Switzerland and as a two-time host of the Winter Olympics, but the possibilities for non-skiers are pretty amazing too. The active can take advantage of all of the usual off-piste options like snowshoeing, and adrenaline seekers won't want to miss the heart-pounding ride on the Olympic bob run that comes complete with a professional pilot and brakeman it reaches speeds of 80 miles per hour.

                    Another fantastic Switzerland resort for non-skiers, Zermatt is not as pricey or flashy as St. Moritz, but it's just as fun. Its streets are car-free for a more peaceful atmosphere and are lined with many upscale nightclubs and shops, while the larger-than-life Matterhorn looms in the background.

                    <h4>THAILAND</h4>
                    A veritable paradise of sugar white sand, crystal clear waters, and dramatic scenery, Thailand's tropical beaches are renowned around the globe for their beauty. Unfortunately, mass tourism has destroyed some of them. Remember The Beach? Well, these days you'll have to look a little harder to find the utopian paradise of the 1990s cult backpacker novel on Thailand's Andaman coast. However, little gems still shine brightly on Phi Phi island. And some of the country's most luxurious resorts such as the phenomenal resort of Soneva Kiri  still feature their own private, pristine beach.

                    <h4>PHILIPPINES</h4>
                    With more than 7000 islands dotted with beautiful white sand beaches that are lapped by warm aquamarine seas and edged by spectacular coral reefs, picking a favorite beach in the Philippines may sound like a challenging task. El Nido in Palawan, often dubbed as the Philippines' last frontier, is definitely one the best destinations in the country, not only because of the powder-fine beaches and gin-clear waters, but also because of the area's fabulous limestone formations, towering cliffs, prehistoric caves and thundering waterfalls.

                    The Northwestern area of the American continent boasts some of the most spectacular wild beaches in the worlds, in particular Second Beach in Olympic National Park (USA) and Long Beach in the Pacific Rim National Park (Canada). Do not expect a tropical idyll though, since these areas rank among the wettest places on earth. Here, you can walk on miles of long sandy beaches backed by lush, old-growth rainforest, while watching the thundering waves of the Pacific Ocean with the occasional whale breaching at the horizon.

                    <h4>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</h4>
                    Queensland has hundreds of world-class beaches, each offering a distinctive experience. Whitehaven Beach, located on the largest of the Whitsunday Islands, is often voted amongst the world's most beautiful beaches; stretching over 3,7 miles (6km) and boasting brilliant silica sand, among the purest in the world, you'll soon realize why. Another favorite is Seventy-five Mile Beach, which is Australia's premier four-wheel driving location and runs along Fraser Island's east coast; the fabulous beach boasts miles upon miles of pristine sand and sea, as well as a vast array of wildlife.

                    Cape Town, often dubbed South Africa's Mother City and IMHO the world's most beautiful city, has some of the world's most spectacular beaches on its doorsteps, just minutes from the city center at the foot of the epic Table Mountain. From the family friendly beaches on the False Bay coastline to the gorgeous beaches for the rich and beautiful on the incredibly spectacular Atlantic Seaboard, you're sure to find a stretch of sand that suits your fancy. My favorite Capetonian beaches are Camps Bay, Clifton and Llandudno.

                    Besides jaw-dropping natural scenery (think active volcanoes, towering cliffs, and dense jungle), the Hawaiian islands also boast some of the best beaches in the world. Some built around the high drama of intense waves crashing against razor-sharp lava rocks; some so remote that they are only accessible by helicopter or landing watercraft; and some are so hidden and gorgeous that they need to remain a secret. The islands of Kauai and Maui are best for travelers looking for a relaxing beach holiday (but don't forget to explore the incredible landscapes outside the resorts).

Just 12 miles (19 km long), the lush little slipper of land called Bora Bora lies in French Polynesia's most mesmerizing lagoon edged by fine white sandy shores. Luxurious over-water bungalows nestled over the world's most beautiful lagoon with a tropical backdrop make Bora Bora a top destination for the discerning traveler.

While their western neighbors of the Bahamas went mass with their lost-on-the-way-to-Las-Vegas resorts, the Turks went class, quietly opening a string of very luxurious resorts in the past decade.

The islands are blessed with stunning white beaches, crystal clear blue lagoons, incredible underwater wildlife, and unrivaled luxury resorts.

                    Mother Nature was extremely generous when she created the archipelago of the Seychelles, comprised of 115 scenic islands scattered in the Indian Ocean east of Kenia. The beauty of the Seychellois beaches is beyond words and unmatched anywhere else in the world: exquisite ribbons of powdery-soft white sand are lapped by turquoise waters and backed by palm tree covered hills and big rocky boulders.
